Project Ideas


      1.	Project​ ​title​: Blockchain-Apartment Rental Project.

Project description:​ In this project, we would like to implement Blockchain technology in apartment rental transaction workflow. For people who have experience in renting apartment, leasing offices make the thing look easy. However, it can be quite complicated in reality. A significant challenge nowadays faced by apartment rental networks is that the supporting information systems are often disintegrated. Blockchain technology provides a possibility where every member in this network could monitor access and share and analyze consistent and up-to-date information.

     2.	Project​ ​title​: Provenance and asset quality in oil using blockchain.
Project description:​ Oil companies frequently contract with third-party blenders to manufacture specialty products. The risk of counterfeits—which can bleed revenue and erode the value of a respected brand—is a concern for manufacturers. The project will provide tracking provenance for authenticity and quality control. This can implemented by a blockchain transaction ledger that track the sourcing and provenance of raw materials and products from suppliers and tollers through blending and first fill, wholesale and retail channels. The ledger could include digital data linked to unique identifiers on labels. If the unique code on the label is not traceable to the blockchain data, the product can be assumed to be counterfeit. 



     3.     Project​ ​title​: loyalty program
 Project description:​ Many small business owners are struggling today to    repeatedly bring their customers back to them or increase customer visits. They can’t afford creating their own loyalty program and maintaining the infrastructure for it.We propose a solution which empowers the SMB by providing them a multi-tenant
platform which provides the loyalty program and campaigns over the cloud. Business
owners can create their custom campaign or reuse the basic ones. They can
customize the loyalty based on number of visits or based on amount spent by the
customer.
Customer just need to provide their digital card number associated with their account
and scan it to make the payment. Using the recommender, platform will provide
personalized recommendation to the customer on what they may like from the
business.

# Proposed​ ​methodology/ ​ ​resources: 
We will be implementing this application using Java and bluemix platform. We will be using Kafka to pass around the information.
Nosql DB (KV store) to store customer information, profile and preferences.
Our platform will be multi-tenant providing a dashboard for customer and another
view for business owner. Business owner can customize details, connect and
provide more personalized campaign and recommendation to their users.
